        Due to the advancement of technology, today we have various types of electronic devices with different
        dimensions such as laptops, mobiles, tablets, desktop computers, smartwatches, etc. Therefore, users can use
        their internet to access the webpage, applications, etc. on any of these devices. Further, the design developed
        for one electronic product size might not be compatible with the other electronic devices with different
        dimensions. For instance, the application design made for the iPhone may not be functional for android devices.
        Hence, this is where the term responsive design comes into practice. Responsive design means designing the
        application, webpages, etc., based on the user’s environment or electronic devices.<br><br>
        In addition, good web developers always utilize responsive design techniques in their web technologies. In the
        initial stage, using media queries in CSS can be one of the best ways to create responsive web applications.
        Media queries can be configured or customized according to the user’s electronic device sizes. Also, the
        utilization of flexible grid, flexbox, jQuery, using percentage, and viewport to size the content, etc., can
        assist the developer to create the design with less coding which can be compatible with numerous devices.
        Furthermore, designing web applications according to the users’ browsers because applications developed for
        Firefox may not be compatible with Google Chrome. Hence, integrating responsive design into the various web
        technologies is a good trait of the web developer.<br><br>
        Today, due to the popularity of mobile devices because of their portability, reliability, etc., many users
        access the internet through their mobile phones rather than desktop and laptops. In addition, in today’s market,
        there are various kinds of mobiles of different shapes and sizes. Hence, web developers must always create a
        design that is functional for mobile devices. On the other hand, it can also be a big challenge for web
        developers to create a website based on the different sizes of mobile phones. Therefore, based on my knowledge
        and research, while creating a web app, the developer must not only prioritize their design for desktops or
        laptops but also for mobile phones. Furthermore, devices with a big screen can include many contents while
        including every content on the small devices can be challenging. But, with good design, the designer can create
        a beautiful responsive design for every device including small electronic devices without compromising any of
        its content and functionality. For this, the designer can utilize a flexible grid, media queries, use of
        percentages to size the content, etc.<br><br>
        Lastly, I am extremely grateful that I had the opportunity to develop skills in this course as I got to learn a
        lot about web development from this course and from my professor. Firstly, I got to learn about various ways to
        declare a function in JavaScript, different data types in JavaScript, the use of regular expressions for
        validating a form, DOM manipulation, various CSS selectors, different event handlers, and built-in methods, HTML
        elements, CSS properties and more. The opportunity to learn all this content as well as the supportive and
        interactive nature of my professor made my experience extremely positive while taking part in this course.
        Furthermore, after completing this course, I feel more confident in creating a dynamic website by utilizing all
        the learnings from this course. All in all, I want to thank Seneca and my professor for providing me with this
        opportunity to learn about website development, and I look forward to future courses affiliated with website
        development.
